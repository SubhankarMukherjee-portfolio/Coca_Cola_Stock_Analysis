# Coca Cola Stock Analysis (By using Python – Jupyter Notebook)
Coca-Cola is one of the most iconic global beverage brands, and its stock has a long trading history on U.S. financial markets. This project analyzes a dataset containing Coca-Cola's historical stock data from 1962 to 2022. The dataset includes daily records of adjusted closing price, opening price, high, low, and trading volume. The analysis was conducted using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The primary objective was to explore long-term trends, price movements, volume fluctuations, and statistical patterns through various visualizations and regression techniques to understand the stock’s performance and investor behavior over six decades.

## Dataset used
Dataset = "https://github.com/SubhankarMukherjee-portfolio/Coca_Cola_Stock_Analysis/blob/main/Coca-Cola_stock_history.csv"

## Objectives of the project
1) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Coca-Cola's historical stock data
2) Understand trends in adjusted closing price, opening price, volume, highs, and lows over time
3) Analyze yearly, monthly, and daily patterns using regression and statistical techniques
4) Visualize findings using Python and data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn


## Questions solved
1) What is the trend of Coca-Cola’s adjusted closing price from 1962 to 2022 (daily and monthly view)?
2) How does the adjusted opening price behave over the years and months?
3) What are the yearly average trends in adjusted closing and opening prices using regression analysis?
4) When did Coca-Cola stock reach its maximum high and minimum low prices?
5) How has the trading volume changed over time (daily, monthly, and yearly trends)?
6) What statistical insights can be drawn from the regression analysis of yearly average prices and volume?
7) Which months typically show higher or lower average prices and trading volumes?
8) What are the economic implications of volume and price trends over six decades?
9) How do seasonal or monthly patterns affect stock behavior?
10) What significant historical market movements are reflected in Coca-Cola’s stock trends?

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used during the data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and analysis phases:
1) NumPy – for performing numerical operations and handling arrays
2) Pandas – for data manipulation, filtering, and analysis of time series data
3) Matplotlib – for creating basic visualizations like line plots and bar charts
4) Seaborn – for enhanced and statistical data visualization with trend lines
5) Scikit-learn (sklearn) – for linear regression modeling and evaluating statistical significance (R², p-values)
6) Statsmodels – for advanced regression analysis and statistical testing
7) Datetime – for converting and formatting date/time values during time series processing

## Final Observations & Storyline
1) The Coca-Cola stock has shown impressive long-term growth, with the adjusted closing price rising from just $0.037 in 1962 to over $65 by 2022. This upward trend, confirmed by strong regression metrics (R² = 0.757), highlights the company’s consistent market performance and investor confidence over six decades.
2) Both daily and monthly adjusted prices show seasonal patterns, with prices typically peaking mid-year (around August) before dipping slightly in the fall. Opening prices mirror this trend, suggesting consistent investor behavior. The highest price ($66.24) occurred around April–May 2022, while the lowest ($0.0349) dates back to 1962, framing a historic growth narrative.
3) Trading volume has also scaled dramatically—from under 0.2 million shares in early years to over 124 million at recent peaks. Monthly volume trends reveal heightened activity early in the year (Feb–Mar) and tapering off by year-end, reflecting cyclical investor sentiment. Yearly regression on volume shows strong statistical significance, supporting the trend of growing market engagement.
4) Overall, the analysis affirms Coca-Cola’s long-term stock as a model of stability and growth. Despite short-term fluctuations, both price and volume data demonstrate resilience, strategic investor interest, and a powerful brand legacy that has weathered market cycles and continued to grow steadily.
